These files were used to explain how to create header files using a summation with vector (project hint here) and factorial. Contains 3 files:
1. The main.cpp file
2. The math.h header file with prototypes (fucntion interfaces)
  - No guards or other definitions were added as these will be covered Thursday
3. The math.cpp file with actual functions
