# basic-CPP-examples
Repository of C++ example programs used in lectures or as supplements for teaching various programming methodologies.

1. 𝘓𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 1: focused on different output methods with variables using 2 types that are (typically) less explored in intro courses.
2. 𝘓𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 2: Introduced std::array over c-style arrays, reviewed while & for(each) loops, and reviews controls structures (if/else)
3. 𝘓𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦 3: Introduced vectors and reviews control structures (switch) by updating Lecture 2's code
4. VectorPart1 is a version of the completed homework; Lecture 4 adds a few functions to rock, paper, scissors
5. 𝘚𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥𝘶𝘭𝘦𝘳𝘗𝘢𝘳𝘵1: First version which students will use to complete an assignment.
6. 𝘏𝘦𝘢𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘋𝘪𝘳𝘦𝘤𝘵𝘰𝘳𝘺: Directory with first header introductory code
7. 𝘚𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘤𝘵𝘶𝘳𝘦𝘌𝘹𝘢𝘮𝘱𝘭𝘦: A very basic example of a structure and passing by reference (there are 2)
8. 𝘔𝘰𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘦 𝘊𝘭𝘢𝘴𝘴: This just shows very basic class structure with basic overloading and overriding
9. 𝘞𝘢𝘭𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨𝘛𝘩𝘦𝘚𝘤𝘳𝘦𝘦𝘯: This shows moving using Keyboard events, moving items in an array, using abstract classes and project structure
