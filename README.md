Repository of C++ example programs used in lectures or as supplements for teaching various programming methodologies.

1. Lecture 1: focused on different output methods with variables using 2 types that are (typically) less explored in intro courses.
2. Lecture 2: Introduced std::array over c-style arrays, reviewed while & for(each) loops, and reviews controls structures (if/else)
